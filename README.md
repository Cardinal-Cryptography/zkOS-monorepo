# Shielder: A First Iteration of zkOS

Welcome to Shielder, the first iteration of zkOS by Aleph Zero.
Shielder is designed to provide a seamless integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) privacy into Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible environments with subsecond proving times.

## Introduction

Shielder is part of the Aleph Zero zkOS initiative, aimed at delivering Privacy-as-a-Service for Web3. With zkOS, developers can integrate ZK-based privacy into their applications without deep cryptographic knowledge.

## Features

- **EVM Compatibility**: Easily integrate with existing Ethereum-based applications.
- **Subsecond Proving**: Achieve zero-knowledge proofs in 600-800 ms on standard hardware.
- **High Performance**: Supports up to 250ms block time and processes thousands of transactions per second.
- **Developer-Friendly**: Comprehensive tooling and frameworks to simplify integration.
- **Privacy-Enhanced**: Build and deploy privacy-enhanced applications effortlessly.

# Architecture

Shielder is built utilizing the following components:

- **EVM Layer 2 Rollup**: Leverages Arbitrum Anytrust DAC technology for fast and secure execution.
- **Developer Tooling**: Includes Gelatoâ€™s web3 services, account abstraction, functions, VRF, oracles, block explorers, indexers, and multisig support.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)
- An Ethereum wallet

### Usage

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Cardinal-Cryptography/zkOS-monorepo.git
cd zkOS-monorepo
make deps
```

Boot a local node:

```bash
make anvil
```

Compile & deploy the smart contract suite:

```bash
make deploy-contracts
```

### Running e2e tests

Run:

```bash
run tooling-e2e-tests/full_scenario.sh
```

(or another `.sh` file from that directory). For maximum compatibility `export BUILD=docker` - this will be slower but
will build the relayer image inside docker. Otherwise the binary is built on your machine and then copied into the image
which might not work, depending on the exact configuration of the host.

### Deploying to anvil

The command below will use `0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266` as a deployer:

```bash
NETWORK=anvil make deploy-contracts
```
